# Interface between MATLAB programming language and HEC-RAS water modelling software

This is a repository of the code presented in the article **Design of a MATLAB HEC-RAS Interface to Test Advanced Control Strategies on Water Systems** https://doi.org/10.3390/w13060763

## Limitations

Due to GitHub limitations, zipped "essential" package could not be uploaded to GitHub. 

Instead, code is available and docs will be converted to GitHub Docs in a future release.
